A WiFi USB-stick, i.e. a wireless NAS for remotely upload songs to your car! it is actually an idea from 2012, but I didn't complete it at the time. Now we've got better CPUs and radios, so...

This is based upon PIC32MM and AT WINC1500. It shows up as a USB Mass-memory device, and allows remote access via FTP (for reading and writing) and also a simple Web interface for configuration and status/diagnostics.

(I know that most of you use spotify and alike nowadays... but you're wrong (as usual): because you're paying money for not owning a thing!!
It's much better to buy CDs and upload them to your car)
